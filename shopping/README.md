This project is a nearest-neighbor classifier to solve the problem of "How could a website determine a user’s purchasing intent?". Given information about a user — how many pages they’ve visited, whether they’re shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, etc. — this classifier will predict whether or not the user will make a purchase. This classifier won’t be perfectly accurate — perfectly modeling human behavior is a task well beyond the scope of this class — but it is better than guessing randomly. To train this classifier, Data set provided by Sakar, C.O., Polat, S.O., Katircioglu, M. et al. Neural Comput & Applic (2018) with some data from a shopping website from about 12,000 users sessions is used. It uses sensitivity and specificity to measure the accuracy.
